# PODKAT - An R Package for Association Testing Involving Rare and Private Variants
This package provides an association test that is capable
of dealing with very rare and even private variants. This is
accomplished by a kernel-based approach that takes the
positions of the variants into account. The test can be used
for pre-processed matrix data, but also directly for variant
data stored in VCF files. Association testing can be performed
whole-genome, whole-exome, or restricted to pre-defined regions
of interest. The test is complemented by tools for analyzing
and visualizing the results.

This is the source code repository. The package can be installed from
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/podkat.html).
